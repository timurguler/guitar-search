About This Listing
I am selling my Eastman E10-00SS Acoustic Guitar with a brand new Deluxe Silver Creek Hardshell Case. This Eastman E10-00SS comes with a solid Adirondack Spruce top, with solid Mahogany back and sides. This Eastman is in excellent shape with only some finish checking near the bridge which is very hard to photograph, and this guitar has one crack to the left of the endpin which has been professionally glued, and cleated, and should be stable. You will find two photos showing the crack before it was repaired, and a closeup of the repaired area. For a small bodied 00 style guitar, this guitar has surprising punch, and volume. This guitar while not a mint example, it is in excellent shape, and ready to make the new owner a very happy player.  It has been completely cleaned, the fretboard oiled, and restrung with D'Addario XT Light Gauge strings.  I am asking $929 for this Eastman.  It is a great small guitar.
